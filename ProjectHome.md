<font size='5'>03/17/2013: Current mplayer2 git is unbuildable due to API changes to Libav, a new build will be available once mplayer2 is fixed upstream</font>

The latest version is featured under "Downloads". My MPlayer2 builds are packed using <a href='http://www.7-zip.org'>7-Zip</a> and can be extracted using any archiving program compatible with the 7-Zip format. There is no installer, extract anywhere you like and either run directly from a command prompt or install/configure a GUI frontend such as <a href='http://smplayer.sourceforge.net'>SMPlayer</a> to use it.<br>

SMPlayer is a free and open source GUI for MPlayer featuring a configurable, skinnable and easy to use interface with features such as remembering your position in a video, localization, subtitle search, and YouTubeâ„¢ video search and playback.
